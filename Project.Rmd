```
##0. Adding libraries
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")                          
install.packages("plyr")                           
install.packages("readr")

library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
library(readr)
```
##1. Merging files. ldply function in plyr library automatically reassigns types
if they are incompatible
```{r}
merger <- function(path) {
  setwd(path)
  ldply(list.files(path), read.csv, header=TRUE)
}
dataset <- merger("C:/RStudio/Codes/Data")
```
##2. EDA.
We start by looking at the data
```{r}
summary(dataset)
```
It has the character types in columns that normally should be doubles
meaning that some values couldn't be formatted as doubles (words?)
We can force it though, these values will be swapped with NAs
```{r}
dataset$Rings <- as.double(dataset$Rings)
names(dataset)[2] <- "sex"
dataset$sex <- as.double(dataset$sex)
dataset$Length <- as.double(dataset$Length)
```
Sex can now be presented as factor:
```{r}
dataset$sex <- as.factor(dataset$sex)
```
Alternative here would be expelling the student who made the files.
Also these "text values" can be found  using if clauses
We just assume there are not much of them and it doesn't worth writing longer code

Visualising outliers
```{r}
boxplot(dataset)
```
#For better scaling:
```{r}
boxplot(dataset[-c(1, 2)])
```

#covariations
```{r}
plot(dataset[-2])
```
Most, if not all, stats look to be positively correlated with each other!
Some of those correlations might mean direct dependencies, 
both linear and non-linear. For example, the higher total weight is derived
from higher weights of body parts

##3. Means and medians by sex
```{r}
dataset2 <- filter(dataset, !is.na(sex))
dataset2 <- group_by(dataset2, sex)
a <- summarise(dataset2, 
               means = mean(Length, na.rm = TRUE), 
               sds = sd(Length, na.rm = TRUE))
View(a)
```

##4. Height>0.165
```{r}
low <- filter(dataset, Height <= 0.165)
percent <- nrow(low)/nrow(dataset)*100
percent
```

##5. 92% percentile
```{r}
datasetL <- filter(dataset, !is.na(Length)) %>%
  arrange(Length)
perc = nrow(datasetL) * 0.92
datasetL$Length[perc]
```

##6. Z-scores
```{r}
a_total <- summarise(dataset, 
                     means = mean(Length, na.rm = TRUE), 
                     sds = sd(Length, na.rm = TRUE))
dataset$Length_z_scores <- (dataset$Length - a_total[[1]])/a_total[[2]]
```

##7. Diameters ~ rings
```{r}
young <- filter(dataset, Rings == 5)
old <- filter(dataset, Rings == 15)
boxplot(young$Diameter, old$Diameter, 
        xlab = "Rings", ylab = "Diameter", 
        main = "Mollusk groups by ring number", names = c(5, 15))
```
We can see that (1.5 x IQR)-s of both groups do not overlap, which means that
two groups differ in diameter significantly; 
mollusks with 15 rings have higher diameter

##8. Diameter ~ Whole_weight
In step 2, we saw relations between most parameters. We might plot these two:
```{r}
plot(dataset$Diameter, dataset$Whole_weight,
     xlab = "Diameter", ylab = "Whole_weight")
```
It probably shows non-linear relation between them.
Still, we might use non-parametric correlation:
```{r}
new_set <- filter(dataset, !is.na(Diameter), !is.na(Whole_weight))
cor(new_set$Diameter, new_set$Whole_weight, method = "spearman")
```
We get 0.9712717 as our value, which is very high 
and ensures that correlation is not shallow
It might be good as a linear model, too:
```{r}
summary(lm(Whole_weight ~ Diameter, data = new_set))
```
It's R^2 is 0.857, and residual errors we get are a bit too high though. 
We might try something else.

##9. We might assume our mollusks' mass is distributed equally within volume,
as nothing says otherwise. Then, their weight is proportional to the volume.
If they are also cylindrical (like petry dish),
then their volume is proportional to the surface square.
The square should be dependent on diameter: S = Ï€*d^2 : 4
This means that S (and total weight) should have linear relation with d^2
We can check if this is the case
```{r}
summary(lm(Diameter ~ Whole_weight, data = new_set))
new_set$squaredd <- new_set$Diameter^2
plot(new_set$squaredd, new_set$Whole_weight,
     xlab = "Diameter_squared", ylab = "Whole_weight")
cor(new_set$squaredd, new_set$Whole_weight)
summary(lm(Whole_weight ~ squaredd, data = new_set))
```
We get a linear model: Weight = -0.26 + 6.17*(d^2) 
R^2 = 0.91, which is reasonably good for the highly varied sample.
However, intercept is way below zero, and this model is poor in predicting the
weight at low diameters. The possible explanation here is that this sample forms a part of a logistic curve:
As we can see from the last plot, it has a plateau at low diameters, with some lowest critical weight
(beyond which they can't go, packing tighter their organs instead). In the same way,
it could be expected that there is a max possible weight. 
These mollusks don't reach it though, but maybe some other species do.

Also, it would be interesting to see how we can predict age by other parametres?
Or oppositely, predict any changes to be associated with age?
It looks to be so for height and diameter at least.

removing the couple outliers for scaling:
```{r}
dataset <- filter(dataset, Height < 0.4)
plot(dataset$Rings, dataset$Height,
     xlab = "Rings", ylab = "Height")
plot(dataset$Rings, dataset$Diameter,
     xlab = "Rings", ylab = "Diameter")
```
For these and other parametres, 
it "seems" that they stop growing when mollusk gets 10-11 rings.
They variate highly, however, and it is hard to call these results significant.

One intriguing thing to find here is the ratio between sexes with different ring numbers.
1 - males, 2 - females, 3 - juveniles
```{r}
dataset$Rings <- as.factor(dataset$Rings)
plot(dataset$Rings, dataset$sex,
     xlab = "Rings", ylab = "Sex")
```
It can be clearly seen that the number of juvenile species drops with more rings, 
meaning that their number is corresponds with age well.
the m/f ratio favors males at first but changes to 1:1 later.
This might indicate some variance in their population structure at birth or later.
In some organisms, mortality is high in one sex at birth and soon after.
Also it might mean that the development of sex organs might be prolonged in females,
and they mostly go to "juvenile" group at low ring numbers.
